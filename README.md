# 🌍 AWS Tech U – Cloud Architecture & Leadership Projects (2025)
**Team Lead & Acting CTO (Training Role) | AWS Tech U – Internal Architecture Program**  
**Project:** Global Multi-Region Education Platform (GlobalEdNet)

---

## 🚀 Executive Summary
This project was developed as part of the AWS Tech U internal architecture program.  
As **Acting CTO and Team Lead**, I led the design and delivery of a **multi-region, zero-trust cloud architecture** supporting **47 universities and 2.3M+ students**.  

The solution — *GlobalEdNet Sandbox* — provides a secure, scalable, and compliant environment that accelerates **AI/ML adoption in higher education** while maintaining strict data sovereignty under **GDPR, the Australian Privacy Act, and FERPA**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Higher education institutions face four major operational and strategic challenges:
| Category                    | Key Issues                                                 | Impact                                    |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Legacy Infrastructure**   | 73% of systems >10 years old, limited cloud expertise      | High maintenance cost, low agility        |
| **AI/ML Adoption Barriers** | No secure training environment, no governance              | Research bottlenecks, data exposure risk  |
| **Regulatory Complexity**   | Multi-jurisdictional compliance (GDPR, FERPA, Privacy Act) | Data isolation requirements, audit burden |
| **Financial Constraints**   | Unpredictable workloads, limited budgets                   | Inefficient resource utilization          |

---

## 💡 Solution Overview
We built a **production-grade, multi-region sandbox platform** across:
- **Frankfurt (EU – GDPR)**  
- **Sydney (APAC – Privacy Act)**  
- **Virginia (US – FERPA)**  

### Core Innovations:
- 🧱 **Zero-Trust Security Framework:** Multi-layer defense-in-depth with encryption-by-default and continuous compliance (Config + Security Hub).  
- 🧠 **AI/ML Enablement:** Integrated SageMaker + Bedrock for secure training, inference, and auditability.  
- ⚙️ **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Automated provisioning with CloudFormation/CDK for global consistency.  
- 💸 **Cost Optimization:** Achieved **~40% infrastructure cost reduction** through reserved capacity, intelligent tiering, and scheduled scaling.  
- 🌐 **Regulatory Compliance:** Guaranteed data residency and 100% alignment with GDPR, FERPA, and the Privacy Act.

## 📊 Efficiency Impact
Based on [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.co.uk/blog/average-handle-time/), [Freshworks](https://www.freshworks.com/customer-service/average-handle-time/), and [HDI](https://www.thinkhdi.com/library/supportworld/2019/metric-of-month-ticket-handle-time) benchmarks,  
manual infrastructure provisioning and compliance validation typically take **3–5 hours per deployment**.  
Through IaC automation and continuous compliance checks, this solution reduced setup time to **<30 minutes**, saving **~80% operational time per region**.
